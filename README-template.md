## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*



## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SASS

- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to do email verification using regular expressions.

### Continued development

I need to work on my CSS, because there is still a lot of stuff to improve.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Generally really good website for people trying to learn coding
